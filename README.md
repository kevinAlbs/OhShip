## Working on ##
- Create barebones game with just controlling velocity, make sure you can
easily turn, back up, etc. Potentially use P2 or a similar library so implementing
more advanced physical constraints (e.g. harpoon) will be simpler
- Get web socket connected to controller and test velocity

## Low Priority ##
- Remove jQuery dependency in controller
- Design a realistic theme for the controller

## Notes ##
- In PhysicsEditor, export as Lime+Corona (JSON)
