    + [1 hour] Boundaries with reasonable spawning [done?, about 1.5 hr]
    + [30 minutes] Properly handle leave on client [doneish, about .5 hr]
	+ [30 minutes] Restrict cannon movement to 2^n positions [done, about .25 hr]
	+ [30 minutes] Cap the number of players that can connect [done, about .25 hr]
    + [30 minutes] Share coordinates of cannonball instead of when a fire occurs. [done, about .25 hr]
	+ [1 hour] Interpolate errors smoothly

[3 hours]
- Polishing and bug fixes
- Sanitize input!

OPTIONAL
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Enforce uniqueness among nicknames
=======
- Are messages applied in the right order on the client? I was getting weird issues with cannonballs before, where the cannonball would incorrectly fire the direction of the cannon before rotation.
>>>>>>> Have cannonball message pass angle
- Server tests
- Client tests
- Boundary graphics
- Spike collisions
- Add proper motion to particles
- Add linear interpolation of masking for cannonball collision
- Add jagged mask
- Add cannonball explosion effect
- Add AI players
- Add visual effects for ocean
- Reimplement server in C++
- Send only relevant (in region) messages to respective players
- Use running estimate of latency to predict when movement should occur to reduce error
- Use compact messages
